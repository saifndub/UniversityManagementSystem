			<h3>Message from VC</h3>
			<img src="img/vc.jpg" alt="About Image" />
			<p align="justify" >Notre Dame University Bangladesh was established quite recently, only in 2013, but the 
			experience and the inspiration that brought it into existence have deeper roots in Bangladesh.  
			When Notre Dame College (for boys) and Holy Cross College (for girls) opened their doors almost 
			seventy years ago, the Congregation of Holy Cross, which founded both of them in Dhaka, had already 
			been teaching in the schools of East Bengal for over a hundred years. </p> <br/>
            <p align="justify">This Congregation began in France, which explains the name, since “Notre Dame” is 
			French for “Our Lady,” referring to Mary the mother of Jesus.  From Europe it spread out to 
			many parts of the world. Wherever Holy Cross priests, brothers, and sisters went, they brought 
			a love of learning as well as a devotion to patriotic service, to equitable sharing of the earth’s 
			resources, and to seeking peace by practicing justice.</p> <br/>
            <p align="justify">Our young university owes a great debt of gratitude to Fr. Benjamin Costa, CSC who 
			has recently stepped down after guiding this institution with great care from its tender 
			beginnings. We  also recognize with humble appreciation the appointment of a new Vice 
			Chancellor by the Honorable Abdul Hamid, President of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.  
			We understand that this approval of our efforts and our aspirations implies a large measure 
			of responsibility.  For our part, we eagerly accept this challenge.  We who work at NDUB are 
			committed to providing excellent academic training in every field, with an emphasis on moral 
			integrity and social awareness while providing opportunities for personal growth in terms of 
			both intellectual development and ethical perception. </p> <br/>
			<p align="justify">The core curriculum at NDUB, starting in the first year, includes courses that 
			encourage wholesome self-discipline, critical thinking, and intellectual curiosity.  At 
			the start of their university studies all students receive an introduction to the liberal 
			arts, which aim to enlighten the mind, to guide the heart, and to transform knowledge into 
			wisdom. Since we are already well advanced into the twenty-first century, this includes a 
			foundation course in computer science.</p> <br/>
			<p align="justify">The faculty members at NDUB are dedicated to the same goals as the students, although 
			as teachers and scholars, they lead the way by bringing the old and the new together with a 
			discerning eye.  Our current facilities also reflect a combination of the past and the future.  
			Plans for the construction of a beautiful modern high-rise campus have been completed and 
			ground-breaking should occur before the end of 2017. </p> <br/>
			<p align="justify">NDUB draws upon a rich tradition of local engagement and international participation. 
			A good education, like a true friendship always involves discovery and commitment.  In this 
			spirit, we attempt to stimulate a desire to explore and we seek to nurture the competence and 
			conscience that come with higher learning.  Working together, sharing our talents, and boldly 
			facing present obstacles, we strive to find the right path forward and to follow it. </p> <br/>
